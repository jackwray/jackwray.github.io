			<p class="shortbio">I was born in Winston Salem, NC on December 1, 1999. Raised by my mother, Jennifer Smith Wray, and father, Steve Darby Wray, along with my two sisters, Maggie (19) and Rachel (15). We moved to Atlanta, GA, when I was two years old for my father's work. I attended Jackson Elementary and then moved to Pace Academy as a rising 6th grader. I started coding at the age of 17 in the spring of my junior year.</p>

		<p>Hello, my name is Jack William Wray. Born in Winston Salem, NC, I do not identify as a Tar Heels fan and instead am a true fan to the teams of Atlanta: such as, the Atlanta Hawks, Atlanta Falcons, and the Atlanta Braves. I was named after my two grandfathers, Jack Wray and William Smith. My family consists of my mother, father, two sisters, and two large dogs. Moving to Atlanta, GA during my second year of life, I was enrolled at Jackson Elementary School where my mother served as the head of the Board for two years while my father worked as a neurosurgeon at Piedmont Hospital.</p>
		<p>I was quite the performer during my lower school days, appearing as a lead role in the school's production of Midsummer Night's Dream and a role as a car in School House Rock. As my time at Jackson came to an end (it was only a kindergarden to fifth grade establishment), I decided to follow in my father's footsteps and go to Pace Academy as a 6th grader. There I found a love of sports and athletics rather than theater. In my three years in middle school, I played five different sports, football, tennis, basketball, and ran track and cross country.</p>
		<p>Entering my high school years I had never found a passion other than sports. I was constantly going to play them and constantly practicing for the next time I would get a chance to show my skills. From all this training and practice, I earned a spot on the Varsity Cross Country team, running in the 8 seed out of 10 varsity spots. I also joined the 9th grade basketball team and was a starter for most of the season. In the spring I decided to play tennis and was a swing player, joining Varsity after the JV season had ended.</p>
		<p>My dogs, two female rescues, are named Murphy and Molly. Murphy, a cockerspaniel, was a gift from my dad to my mom when she graduated from college. Murphy now has only one eye due to a tumor pushing against it from behind. She decides on when she wants to eat and almost never leaves my living room. However, Molly is much more entergetic considering she is only nine years old and constatly follows the family around the house no matter where we go. I love both my dogs equally and am hoping we will get more soon.</p>
